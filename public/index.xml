      <description>Step 1: Bring in PackagesIn order to start the process, we must first obtain the Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2 packages. Once obtained, we must bring the packages through ‘library’. We do this as follows:
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)## Loading required package: gsubfn## Loading required package: proto## Loading required package: RSQLitelibrary(ggplot2)Step 2: Extract the DataWe can now begin assembling our Histogram. For this to work, we have to first extract the desired data.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Implement the Required PackagesIn order to begin, we must first bring into our Rmarkdown page the packages Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2. We obtain these packages byt going to tools and then installing the desired packages. We bring these in by using ‘library’ as shown below.
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)## Loading required package: gsubfn## Loading required package: proto## Loading required package: RSQLitelibrary(ggplot2)Step 2: Extract the DataAfter installing the packages,and bringing them into the Rmarkdown through ‘library’, we are then ready to extract our chosen data.</description>

      <description>Step 1: Implement all PackagesTo get started, we must first install the packages Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2. We do this by installing the packages through the tool tab, and then integrating them into Rmarkdown through ‘library’. Here it is shown:
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)## Loading required package: gsubfn## Loading required package: proto## Loading required package: RSQLitelibrary(ggplot2)Step 2: Extract the DataIn this example, we would like to work with Time Series.</description>
